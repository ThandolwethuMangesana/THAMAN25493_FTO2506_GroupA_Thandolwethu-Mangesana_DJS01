#  Podcast Stream

Podcast Stream is a responsive, accessible, and interactive web app that allows users to discover and explore podcasts with ease.
It was built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and emphasizes clean code structure, usability, and a polished user interface.

## Overview

the goal was to design and build a responsive web application that allows users to **browse podcast shows** on a landing page and **view detailed information** in a modal. The application should display clear, concise previews of podcast shows and offer additional information through a modal pop-up, **all without navigating away from the page**. Your app should showcase clean code architecture and strong UI/UX design while following JavaScript best practices.

- Each podcast preview must include:
  - Cover image
  - Show title
  - Number of seasons
  - Genre names
  - Last updated date (in a human-readable format)

### 2. Modal View â€“ Show Details

- When a user clicks on a podcast preview, open a modal.
- The modal should include:
  - Larger cover image
  - Podcast title
  - Description of the show
  - Genre tags
  - Last updated date (readable format)
  - List of season titles
  - Number of episodes in each season
- Include a clear and accessible way to **close the modal**.

### ðŸ“± Responsive Design
- **Desktop:** Grid supports up to 8 podcasts per row with two rows visible.
- **Tablet:** Grid adapts to 2â€“4 cards per row.
- **Mobile:** Grid collapses into 1â€“2 cards per row for readability.
- Modal scales fluidly to fit smaller screens.
